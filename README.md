# Hioki IM3536 Lcr meter python IVI driver
python-IVI driver for Hioki IM3536 Lcr meter. possibly not compliant with python ivi

This library serves as a plugin to the python-ivi project licated here: https://github.com/python-ivi/python-ivi
This configures communication between the lcr meter and provides utility functions to set perameters as well as read measurements. 


This singular python file should eventually be transitioned into 2 or more. one to support lcr meters in general, and one for this lcr meter
